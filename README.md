# Overview

Hi! Im Joseph, and I wanted to use a cloud database system.

I created a script in python and a Realtime database in Firebase to store data for note taking.

I wanted to make this app to see how to create a cloud database. I had used SQL before, and wanted to see how a cloud database would be different.
